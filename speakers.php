<div class="content">
<br>
<p><strong>ABSTRACT: </strong>Generally, doctors or neurologists perform diagnosis of various brain disorders based on visual scanning of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. This type of diagnosis approach requires lots of manual effort and time especially for long data recordings. Moreover, such a diagnosis procedure requires expertise and training. Due to these reasons, there is a lot of interest in the literature to develop automated techniques based on advanced signal processing and artificial intelligence methods in order to design intelligent systems/expert systems/computer-aided medical diagnosis systems. These developed systems are very helpful for early detection of various brain related disorders using EEG signals so that timely treatment can be provided. In addition, such automated systems can assist doctors or neurologists in their diagnosis. In this talk, advanced signal processing techniques like empirical wavelet transform and iterative filtering will be explained for automated diagnosis of epilepsy and schizophrenia diseases</p>

<br>
<p><strong>ABSTRACT: </strong>In the last few decades, the ever-growing demand for high data rate in wireless communication has compelled the antenna engineering community to look for a technology that can provide high data rate within a limited frequency spectrum. Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technology is one of the promising solutions for this, where multiple antennas are used in both transmitting and receiving ends. In such MIMO systems, multiple independent channels are created, which enhance the data rate significantly, without any additional requirement of bandwidth or transmitting power. In this talk the design challenges for MIMO Antenna System would be presented and discussed. Some state-of-the-art MIMO antenna systems proposed by our group will also be presented.</p>
