			'Prof.Yashimoto is currently in  Dept. of Electronics at Kyoto Institute of Technology in Japan. Prof. Yoshimoto is currently researching the applications photoluminescence in industrial applications as well as a variety of topics in semiconductor materials and processes.
			<br><br>
			After having spent almost thirty years in the United States, I had a bit of cultural shock when I came back to Japan and started teaching as a full-time faculty member at SILS in the fall of 2010. I am not sure if I have returned to where I originally came from, or arrived in an uncannily familiar yet ultimately alien land. It is certainly an unsettling experience, and yet I think it is important to keep looking awry at Japan from an eccentric—i.e., neither Japanese nor foreign—perspective. I received a Bachelor of Arts in Cinema from the State University of New York at Binghamton, and a Master of Arts in Film and Television Studies from UCLA. At UC San Diego, in addition to film and media, I studied Japanese literature, literary theory, and comparative criticism, and earned my Ph.D. degree in Comparative Literature. 
			<br><br>
			Before coming to SILS, he taught at New York University and at the University of Iowa as Associate Professor for nearly two decades. At SILS, he primarily teach media/film studies courses, but depending on students interest, may offer courses on critical theory and literature-related topics. I very much look forward to seeing many of you in my courses.
