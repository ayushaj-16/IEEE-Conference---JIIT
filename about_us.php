        <h2 class="amn">JIIT</h2>
        <p>Jaypee Institute of Information Technology (JIIT) was founded in 2001 with the vision of becoming a centre of excellence in the field of IT and related emerging areas of education, training and research comparable to the best in the world for producing professionals who shall be leaders in innovation, entrepreneurship, creativity and management.  </p>
        <br><br>
        
        <h2 class="amn ">ECE Department</h2>
        <p>The Electronics and Communication Engineering Department was formed in the year 2002.Besides running a 4-year B.Tech. degree and a 5-year Integrated B.Tech - M.Tech. degree program, the Department also runs three M.Tech. degree programs with specializations in Wireless Communication, Machine Learning and Signal Processing, Microelectronic Systems And IOT.The Department has strong research programmes leading to Ph.D. degree in cutting edge research areas of Electronics and Communication Engineering.</p>
        <p>The salient features of the degree programs are:
            <ul>
            <li>Inculcate analytical approach,</li>
            <li>Adequate number of courses on humanities and personality development,</li>
            <li>Judicious mix of hardware and software based experiments,</li>
            <li>Emphasis on learning through design and simulation,</li>
            <li>Open ended laboratory problems,</li>
            <li>Minor specialization in other disciplines,</li>
            <li>IEEE student chapter,</li>
            <li>Creativity and Innovation Cell,</li>
            <li>Higher emphasis on project and project based learning, and</li>
            <li>State-of-the-Art courses in Mobile Communications, Optical Communications, Telecommunication Networks, Signal Processing, Microelectronics, Digital System Design,Machine Learning, Embedded Systems and MEMS.</li></ul>
            Key feature of these programs is their balanced core and flexible elective structure. The curriculum is designed to provide a good foundation and the development of an all-round engineering outlook.</p>
