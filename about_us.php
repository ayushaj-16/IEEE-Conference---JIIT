        <h2 class="amn ">ECE Department</h2>
        <p>The Electronics and Communication Engineering Department was formed in the year 2002.Besides running a 4-year B.Tech. degree and a 5-year Integrated B.Tech - M.Tech. degree program, the Department also runs two M.Tech. degree programs with specializations in Communication Systems (CS) and Microelectronics & Embedded Technology (MET).</p>
        <p>The salient features of the degree programs are:
            <ul>
            <li>Inculcate analytical approach,</li>
            <li>Adequate number of courses on humanities and personality development,</li>
            <li>Judicious mix of hardware and software based experiments,</li>
            <li>Emphasis on learning through design and simulation,</li>
            <li>Open ended laboratory problems,</li>
            <li>Higher emphasis on project and project based learning, and</li>
            <li>State-of-the-Art courses in Mobile Communications, Optical Communications, Telecommunication Networks, Signal Processing, Microelectronics, Digital System Design, Embedded Systems and MEMS.</li></ul>
            Key feature of these programs is their balanced core and flexible elective structure. The curriculum is designed to provide a good foundation and the development of an all-round engineering outlook.</p>
